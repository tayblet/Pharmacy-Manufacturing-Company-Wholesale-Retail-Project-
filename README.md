## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized as a primary tool for a quick and initial exploration of the dataset to get a preliminary understanding of the data, inspect it, and understand its structure.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: The dataset was imported into Microsoft SQL Server from Excel for analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used to create visualizations of the analysis to gain more insights into the business questions.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the project documentation and version control.

## Data Cleaning
These processes were carried out using SQL Server Management Studio:
1. **Null Value Identification**:
   - The query identifies columns with null values: Distributor, Customer Name, City, Country, etc.
2. **Data Correction**:
   - Negative Quantity Correction: Negative quantities in the Quantity column are corrected by converting them to absolute values.
   - Missing Sales Calculation: Missing Sales values are calculated by multiplying Quantity and Price.
   - Quantity Rounding: Quantities are rounded to the nearest integer.
3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Duplicate Removal: The query identifies and removes duplicate rows based on multiple columns.
   - Data Standardization: The TRIM and LOWER functions are used to remove leading/trailing spaces and convert text to lowercase, ensuring consistency across the dataset.
4. **Column Renaming**:
   - The sp_rename procedure is used to rename the Sub_channel column to Sub_Channel for consistency.

## Advanced Analysis
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Summarizes data by categories for insights into trends.
- **Window Functions**: Identifies and removes duplicates for data integrity.
- **Conditional Logic**: Converts month names to numbers for sorting.
- **Joins and Subqueries**: Combines data from multiple tables for complex analysis.
- **Temporary Tables and CTEs**: Breaks down complex queries for readability.
